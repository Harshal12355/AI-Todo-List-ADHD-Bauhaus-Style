# Integrations (`src/integrations/`)

This directory contains code specifically related to integrating the application with third-party services or libraries.

## Purpose

Isolating integration-specific code here helps to:

-   Keep the core application logic clean and decoupled from external service details.
-   Make it easier to manage, update, or replace integrations in the future.

## Examples Found

-   **`supabase/`**: Contains code related to the Supabase platform. This could include:
    -   Supabase client initialization.
    -   Authentication functions using Supabase Auth.
    -   Custom logic interacting with Supabase Database or Storage.

## Integration

Modules or functions from this directory are typically imported and used where the specific third-party service functionality is needed. For example:

-   Supabase authentication functions might be used in `src/pages/Login.tsx` or `src/components/auth/`.
-   The Supabase client might be used within `src/services/api.ts` if Supabase provides the backend.
