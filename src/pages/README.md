# Pages (`src/pages/`)

This directory contains the top-level React components that represent the distinct pages or views of the application.

## Role

Each file in this directory typically corresponds to a specific route defined in the application's router (`src/App.tsx`). These components are responsible for:

-   Fetching page-specific data (often using hooks from `src/hooks/` or functions from `src/services/`).
-   Composing layout components (from `src/components/layouts/`) and UI components (from `src/components/ui/` and `src/components/`) to build the page structure and content.
-   Handling page-level state and logic.

## Examples

-   `Index.tsx`: The main landing page.
-   `Login.tsx`: The user login page.
-   `Tasks.tsx`: The page for viewing and managing tasks.
-   `Timer.tsx`: The Pomodoro timer page.
-   `About.tsx`, `Pricing.tsx`: Static or informational pages.
-   `NotFound.tsx`: The page displayed for invalid routes.

## Integration

Page components are primarily imported and rendered by the `Routes` configuration within `src/App.tsx`. They orchestrate the use of components, hooks, services, and contexts to deliver the functionality for a specific URL path.
