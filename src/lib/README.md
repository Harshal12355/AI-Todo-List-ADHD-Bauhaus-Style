# Lib (`src/lib/`)

This directory serves as a collection of utility functions, helpers, constants, or small libraries that are shared across the application but don't belong to a specific feature domain like components, hooks, or services.

## Purpose

-   To promote code reuse for common tasks (e.g., string manipulation, date formatting, validation).
-   To keep other parts of the codebase cleaner by extracting generic logic.

## Examples Found

-   **`utils.ts`**: A common dumping ground for small, miscellaneous utility functions. For larger applications, this might be split into more specific files (e.g., `dateUtils.ts`, `stringUtils.ts`).

## Integration

Functions and constants exported from modules in `src/lib/` are imported and used wherever needed throughout the codebase (components, pages, hooks, services, etc.).
